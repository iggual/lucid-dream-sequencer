# Purpose of This Tool
# This Lucid Dream Sequencer is designed to provide ambient sounds aligned with sleep and lucid dreaming cycles 
# for general wellness purposes. 
# It is not a medical device, treatment, or diagnostic tool. 

# Critical Volume Warning
# Hearing Safety First:

# Never use this script at high volumes, even if you feel you "need" loud sounds to fall asleep. 
# Prolonged exposure to sounds above 85 dB (decibels) can cause permanent hearing damage, 
# especially during sleep when your ears remain sensitive.
# Start at low volumes and adjust only as needed. 

# Avoid using headphones/earbuds at max volume. For reference:
# Normal conversation ‚âà 60 dB
# Busy traffic ‚âà 80 dB
# Headphone max volume ‚âà 100+ dB
# Special Warning for Headphone Users:

# Over-ear headphones or earbuds can deliver sound directly into the ear canal, increasing risk. 
# Consider using noise-canceling headphones at low volumes instead of cranking up the sound to block external noise.
# Do not fall asleep with in-ear devices (e.g., earbuds). They can cause discomfort, ear infections, or increased 
# hearing risk if volume spikes occur.

# Listening Responsibility

# Volume & Duration: Users assume full responsibility for setting safe volume levels and usage durations. 
# Prolonged exposure to loud sounds (even during sleep) may risk hearing damage.

# Personal Health Awareness: If you have tinnitus, hearing loss, sleep disorders, or other medical conditions, 
# consult a healthcare professional before use.
# Environmental Safety: Ensure the sequencer does not interfere with alarms, emergency alerts, or other critical 
# auditory cues in your environment.

# Medical Disclaimer

# This tool is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. 
# Always seek the guidance of a licensed healthcare provider for sleep-related concerns or health questions.
# Do not delay or disregard medical advice based on content or features within this sequencer.

# No Liability for Outcomes

# The creator(s) of this sequencer assume no responsibility for:
# Individual health outcomes, including unintended effects of sound exposure.
# Technical malfunctions (e.g., app crashes, incorrect timing of sounds).
# Any reliance on the sequencer‚Äôs ability to improve sleep quality.

# Final Disclaimer Note

# Use this tool thoughtfully and adjust settings to suit your comfort. If discomfort, irritation, 
# or adverse effects occur, discontinue use immediately.

# Volume Safety Reminder:

# Keep volume below 60% of maximum if unsure.
# For children or sensitive users, supervise use and prioritize extra-low volumes.
# By using this sequencer, you acknowledge and agree to the terms above.

# Proceed only if you understand and accept the risks of using an untested tool.
# Monitor your body‚Äôs response and prioritize safety over "experimentation."
# By using this sequencer, you acknowledge and agree to the terms above.

# Experimental Prototype ‚Äì Not for Medical Use.
